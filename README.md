## Introduction
This repository is a fork of [Co-DETR](https://github.com/Sense-X/Co-DETR), which implements the Co-DETR model—a novel approach to DETR-based object detection introduced in the paper "DETRs with Collaborative Hybrid Assignments Training". We leverage Co-DETR for our task.

In this paper, we present a novel collaborative hybrid assignments training scheme, namely Co-DETR, to learn more efficient and effective DETR-based detectors from versatile label assignment manners. 
1. **Encoder optimization**: The proposed training scheme can easily enhance the encoder's learning ability in end-to-end detectors by training multiple parallel auxiliary heads supervised by one-to-many label assignments. 
2. **Decoder optimization**: We conduct extra customized positive queries by extracting the positive coordinates from these auxiliary heads to improve attention learning of the decoder. 
3. **State-of-the-art performance**: Co-DETR with [ViT-L](https://github.com/baaivision/EVA/tree/master/EVA-02) (304M parameters) is **the first model to achieve 66.0 AP on COCO test-dev.**

## Running

### Install
We implement Co-DETR using [MMDetection V2.25.3](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/releases/tag/v2.25.3) and [MMCV V1.5.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/releases/tag/v1.5.0).
The source code of MMdetection has been included in this repo and you only need to build MMCV following [official instructions](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/tree/v1.5.0#installation).
We test our models under ```python=3.7.11,pytorch=1.11.0,cuda=11.3```. Other versions may not be compatible. 

### Data
The COCO dataset and LVIS dataset should be organized as:
```

        ├── train2017
        └── val2017        
```
